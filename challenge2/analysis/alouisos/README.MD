SOLUTION TO CHALLENGE No2 

This was a beatiful challenge indeed. I am super enthusiastic with the potential of data visualizations. 

I worked around the missing data with Octave loops. 
You may run the m file in a directory that includes the total_watt.csv file and 
everything will be automated with output on the screen till the creation of:   

1) Graph of production per 30 minutes 
2) Bar graph of production per day. 

Medium data production was considered the mean average of production and high more than mean average plus a standard deviation and vice versa for low. 

I did not want to use the elementary plot functionality of Octave to produce other 
visualizations. 

So I extracted the daily data in json format and decided to use calendar heatmap with my 
favorite visualization tool the D3js 

You may open the "energy_heatmap.html" file for visualization of the cluster of production in low-medium-high 
category in a calendar format. I used a bootstrap template for HTML - CSS and Javascript of course for the visualization with the Heatmap.js tool. 

This can be generalized into a web platform of an elegant real time visualization of server data for example for users on their mobile phone or for us in control center. 

I would love to experiment more with your data and Cubism.js or other D3js tools. I crave for data.

Thanks for the challenge.
