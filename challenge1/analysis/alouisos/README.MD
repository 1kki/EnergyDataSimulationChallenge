This is my solution to your first challenge. 

The whole point is to provide an agile process through a script that can be used 
over and over again in any type of data that can be analyzed in a single machine 
or a chunk of data for quick prototyping before using Mahout and Hadoop. 

The script is called machinelearningscipt.m and the language of preference is Octave. 

Best MAPE till now is achieved with polynomial regression with normal equation solution. 

More efforts through SVMs and neural networks will be added soon.
